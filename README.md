# Support Vector Regression (SVR) Kernel Comparison Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the impact of different kernel functions in Support Vector Regression (SVR) on predictive performance using Python. The results are visualized through various graphs and metrics for better understanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed or accessible:
- **Google Colab** (Preferred)
- Python 3 (if running locally)
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### Downloading and Running the Notebook

1. **Download the Repository**:
   - Download the project as a ZIP file from the provided link or repository.
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

2. **Upload to Google Colab**:
   - Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Click on **File > Upload Notebook**.
   - Upload the `SVR_Tutorial.ipynb` file from the extracted folder.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook.
   - Ensure all code cells are executed in sequence for correct output.

### Running Locally

Alternatively, if you prefer running the notebook on your system:

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Install Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Install the dependencies using:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
     ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Navigate to the folder where `SVR_Tutorial.ipynb` is located.
   - Start Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open the `SVR_Tutorial.ipynb` file and execute the cells sequentially.

## Project Structure

- `SVR_Tutorial.ipynb`: The main notebook file containing the tutorial and code.
- `README.md`: Instructions for running the project (this file).
- `LICENCE`: The project is licensed under this license.

## Key Features

- Comparison of four SVR kernels: Linear, Polynomial, RBF, and Sigmoid.
- Visualization of residual distributions and predicted vs. actual values.
- Performance evaluation through MSE and RÂ² metrics.

## Notes

- Ensure a stable internet connection if running on Google Colab.
- If you encounter issues with missing libraries, install them using pip commands.
- Adjust data paths or configurations as needed if running locally.
